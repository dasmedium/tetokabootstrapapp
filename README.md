# Tetoka Education Social Network

This project is the first version of the Tetoka Social Network client application.
A demo of this app can be found [here](https://radiant-reef-72314.herokuapp.com/).
Feel free to create an account and browse around.
Current work in progress to restyle this app from its current bootstrap version to
a newer interface based on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is located in [this repo](https://github.com/dasmedium/dmsocial). All current development and new features will be located there.

This is a nodejs application using Express as backend with a Mongo Sandbox as DB.
Redux handles application state on the front-end.

Tetoka aims to bridge the gap between cryptographic payment networks and incentivised learning.
